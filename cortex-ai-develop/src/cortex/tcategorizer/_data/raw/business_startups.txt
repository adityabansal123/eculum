Why Venture Capital Is In The Deep Freeze
Rewired Launches $100M Robotics-Focused Venture Studio and Fund
Reddit raised $220 MM in VC funds
Reddit is officially a VC unicorn
"This man's potentially huge medical #breakthrough ["the #cure to all #viruses"] can't get funding, so he's trying something desperate" #cowdfunding
A while back I saw a chart of a VC firm's portfolio strategy, it was to fund companies that do a better job of each part of Craigslist. I am trying to find it, but I can't. Does anyone know of the graphic or the fund that is doing this?
