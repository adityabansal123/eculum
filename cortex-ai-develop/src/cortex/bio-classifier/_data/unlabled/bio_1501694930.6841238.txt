A smile hides her pain, a hug masks her heartache, and a laugh covers her tears.
Sometimes, the people whom we've known for only a short amount of time have a bigger impact on us than we've know forever.
Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself.
Sometimes, all you can do is laugh to keep yourself from crying.
Follow your dreams. It probably won't be easy, but it will be worth it.
If she worries about you, it just means she cares. But when she stops caring, that's when you should be worried...

Honestly, I don't have time to hate people who hate me cause I'm too busy loving people who love me.
Fake friends believe in rumors. Real friends believe in you.
When someone is jealous, it just means they're afraid to lose you.

Nothing is better than having someone as your lover AND your best friend.
The 3 C's in life: Choice, Chance, Change. You must make the Choice, to take the Chance, if you want anything in life to Change.
No matter how hard we try to be mature, we will always be kids when we all get hurt and cry.
Good things come to those who wait... Better things come to those who don't give up... and the best things come to those who believe.
Live your life, take chances, be crazy. Dont wait cause right now is the oldest you've ever been &amp; the youngest you'll be ever again.
Believe in the beauty of your dreams. Know that they can be your reality.
The people who are still with you at the end of the day are the ones worth keeping.
True love doesn't have a happy ending because true love never ends.
